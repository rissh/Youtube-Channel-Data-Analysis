Despite all this, students often restrict themselves from getting started with coding, and not only students, but the parents are also not very much active in encouraging their wards to learn to code.  

And we believe now is the time to break this stigma around this conversation and to promote coding culture among students and create genuine interest & curiosity in them to get started with coding. Keeping this in mind, GeeksforGeeks is coming up with an exciting coding tournament exclusively for school students!

But, to make things a bit easier for you, here we have an expert Yogita Sharma with us who is currently working as an SDE II at Careem (Uber) - she will tell you some most worthwhile and effective tips that will surely help you to ace in your upcoming System Design Interviews.

01:44 Checking for Missing Values using isnull()
03:31 Filling Null Values Using fillna()
05:35 Filling Null Values Using fillna(method = 'pad')
